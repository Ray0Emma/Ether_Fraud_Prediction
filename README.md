# Ether_Fraud_Prediction
The goal of this project is to identify instances of blockchain fraud through the application of machine learning. To do so, a dataset with various features such as transaction values, time intervals between transactions, etc., is utilized along with a binary label (FLAG) indicating whether a fraud has occurred (1) or not (0). The project will follow a supervised learning approach, where several classification models will be evaluated and one or more will be chosen based on their balance of recall score and false positive predictions.
